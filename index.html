      <h2 id="HOBBY">MY HOBBIES</h2>
      <p>Whenever I find some free time, I love immersing myself in the world of movies. My favorite genre is science fiction because it challenges the imagination and takes me to worlds beyond our reality. One of my favorite movies is Stranger Things. Aside from watching movies, I also enjoy playing with my cat, trying different cuisines, and capturing nature's beauty through photography.</p>

        <p>One memorable campus moment was during a "Mini Marathon" organized by UTHM, where students came together early in the morning wearing bright yellow t-shirts. The event was all about having fun, not competing, with some running, walking, and even dancing through the course. Volunteers at checkpoints handed out water, snacks, and colorful powders to splash on each other, making it feel festive and energetic. Crossing the finish line together brought a sense of accomplishment, followed by a small party with music and food, leaving everyone sweaty, colorful, and full of laughter. It was a perfect blend of fitness and fun, creating unforgettable memories.</p>
